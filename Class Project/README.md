## This Assignment
Summary: This is one of the projects that we completed in class for the first half of the quarter to practice cleaning and exploring data. 

(The following is the class description) 
In this project, we will investigate restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The scores and violation information have been [made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i). 
The main goal for this assignment is to walk through the process of Data Cleaning and EDA. 

As we clean and explore these data, you will gain practice with:
* Reading simple csv files and using Pandas
* Working with data at different levels of granularity
* Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
* Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables
