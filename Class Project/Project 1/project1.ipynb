One thing that's nice to know is that the median of restuarants score above 90 and the 10% qauntile of restuarants is at 80. As a consumer this implies that for the most 90% of places score higher than an 80, which should give confidence to customers that their food will be clean. "

    "**Your response**: If restaurants scores improved from the first to second inspection we would see this in the histogram with it being centered above 0. It would also ideally would show a right tail, corresponding to resturants making large improvements. But most importantly we want most of the data to be above 0. This is halfway reflected in our histogram above, as it's centered basically at 0 (the mean is .306), but for the most part the graph is consistent with our observations. The histogram of differences is normally distributed, with the median at 0. This indicates that for the most part some restuarants did not improve. As far as analysis goes, it's important to consider though that some resturants didn't \"need\" to improve because the mode for resturant scores was at a perfect 100. Negative differences in these would indicate that things got worse, but in reality moving from a 100 to a 90-something is sort of irrevelavant. For the most part, we cannot gather that much information from the histogram."
